Description of Project
The Atlanta BeltLine to Flint River Trail (Flint River Gateway Trails) is a multi-jurisdictional, regional solution that reconnects communities divided by surface transportation facilities through an ambitious, multi-use, multi-jurisdictional trail. This trail would bridge the transportation barriers to connect schools, hospitals, job centers, Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) rail stations, the BeltLine, and employment centers. The Trail would link disadvantaged communities—a regional collaboration crossing multiple jurisdictions for an area long passed over for federal transportation investments.

Approved Pre-award Costs
On November 14, 2024, Atlanta Regional Commission sent a written request to the FHWA for pre-award approval under 2 C.F.R. 200.458 for costs to prepare for procurement of General Engineering Services contract to begin work on Phase 1 activities. The pre-award approval request would allow the recipient to allocate staff resources to create and release an RFQ and evaluate the responses and for the selected firm to begin work on Phase 1 activities. Atlanta Regional Commission requested pre-award approval for $150,000 in NAE Grant funds or non-Federal funds for match.
The FHWA Office of Acquisition and Grants Management determined that the pre-award costs were incurred directly pursuant to the negotiation and in anticipation of the Federal award and were necessary for efficient and timely performance of the scope of work. That office issued a notice to proceed with pre-award costs on November 14, 2024.

Schedule EChanges from Application
Instructions for completing SCHEDULE E: Describe all material differences between the scope, schedule, and budget described in the application and the scope, schedule, budget described in schedules B–D. The purpose of this schedule E is to clearly and accurately document the differences in scope, schedule, and budget to establish the parties’ knowledge and acceptance of those differences. If there are notable changes in aspects of the Project other than scope, schedule, and budget (e.g., recipient changes), those changes should also be described. See section 3.1 of the General Terms and Conditions.

Scope: As the project was only funded at 40.74% of the initial request, the project has a reduced or modified scope for most elements. In responses to requests from USDOT, ARC provided first a budget and scope for a $50,000,000 project (on February 15, 2024) and second a budget and scope for a $64,900,000 project (on April 24, 2024). Both required significant changes from the project proposed in the original application. The information below compares the project assumptions from the original application to the project outlined in this agreement.

Overall rational for scope changes include:
ARC had intended for GDOT to be the recipient with ARC as a subrecipient. When ARC became the direct recipient, it impacted the requirements for project management and ARC’s role.
ARC applied with a schedule that would have had NEPA taking place later than the obligation deadline. When it became clear that this would not work, ARC moved the schedule. This in turn impacted the choice of segments to construct—some segments were deemed more appropriate for an accelerated schedule. This also lowered the inflation cost on segments going to construction as they were now scheduled to be constructed at least two years earlier.
Changes on activities for each trail segment are listed in the top section of the table below; changes in activities that address the project overall are listed in the lower section of the table below. Please note:
Segments 4 and 8 in the application were split into Segments 4a, 4b, and 4c, and Segments 8a and 8b for this agreement. 
In the application, funding for community engagement was included in the budget for each trail segment; in the agreement community engagement is allocated in one line item for the whole project. 
In the application, project inspection fees and contingency were combined in one line item; in the agreement, project inspection fees and contingency are included in the individual trail segments.
In the application, funding for stormwater planning and monitoring was included in the budget for each trail segment; in the agreement stormwater master planning and monitoring are allocated as separate line items.

------------[lastRenderedPageBreak15]------------------------------------------------------------

Trail Master Planning, Overall Project Community Engagement, Stormwater Planning, Community Capacity Building, and Creative Placemaking/Education were included as scope items in the April 24, 2024 scope/budget revision letter requested by USDOT. The table below reflects the change from the original application to the scope outlined in this agreement.
Trail Master Planning, as addressed in the April 24, 2024 letter, was identified as “Southern Crescent trails connections” and included $1,700,000 for a plan to create east-west connections between the Flint River Trail and trail networks to the east and west. This agreement also adds an additional plan, Flint River Gateway Trails Master Plan with a budget of $1,250,000.

Supporting Narrative.
The Project aligns with ARC’s 2024 Atlanta MSA Priority Climate Action Plan (PCAP), which identifies actions to reduce transportation emissions. Specifically, the strategy “Encourage Transportation Mode Shifts” calls for a mode shift from single occupancy vehicle trips to more sustainable modes, such as transit, biking, and walking, to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Providing multiuse paths that link people to transit stations, neighborhoods, and retail can make it easier for them to choose biking or walking over a car. 
The Trail will provide connectivity between disadvantaged and underserved neighborhoods and increase access to a wide array of destinations. These include major employers, rail transit stations, healthcare facilities, shops, greenspace, recreational facilities, greenspace, schools, and places of worship. The Project accelerates a shift away from single-occupant passenger vehicles by creating transportation choices for individuals to move freely with or without a car.
The Project incorporates nature-based solutions and stormwater management features to mitigate flood risks and improve water quality. The added trees and green spaces will provide relief from extreme heat and lessen the urban heat island effect. Specific design elements will focus on infrastructure enhancements for climate resilience so the community and the Trail can withstand increasingly variable climate conditions. These solutions may include stormwater management system retrofits, slope failure

stabilization, elevation of trail cross-sections, regional stormwater management systems, and incorporation of green infrastructure from GDOT’s Drainage Designs for Highways manual into Project engineering. Design elements will be evaluated and incorporated based on the magnitude of improvement in resiliency and ability to withstand extreme weather events and natural hazards.
